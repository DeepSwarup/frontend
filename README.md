# Face Recognition Attendance System

This is a web-based Face Recognition Attendance System that captures images from a webcam, detects faces, and marks attendance. The application displays the recent attendance entries in a table format. It is built with React for the frontend and communicates with a backend built with flask using API interactions.

## Features

- Capture images from a webcam for face recognition.
- Display recent attendance entries in a table.
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.
- Stylish and professional UI with a dark theme.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed on your system.
- Backend server running locally (assumed to be at `http://localhost:5000`).

## OpenCV Usage
- Image Processing: Provides various functions to perform image transformations, filtering, and geometric operations.
- Face Detection: Uses pre-trained models and algorithms to detect faces in images.
- Face Recognition: Facilitates recognizing faces by comparing them with known faces in the database.
- Real-Time Processing: Efficiently processes video streams and images in real-time, making it suitable for live webcam applications.

## Libraries

- OpenCV
- dlib
- cmake
